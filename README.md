# DiceRoller

Created a dice roll calculator for an upcoming tabletop RPG.

Handles attacks and challenges along with the various defensive options.

The form will dynamically update to show only the required fields, and the output lines will match the options chosen.

Debug options will allow the user to decide the roll values rather than having them be generated randomly.

Minimum SDK version is 17 (Jelly Bean)
